    "What is a class? It is a code template for creating object.\n",

    "What is abstraction? We don't need to know the complete logic, just to use it.\n",
    "What is inheritance? One class takes on the attributes and methods of another.\n",
    "What is multiple inheritance? The derived class is derived from more than one base class\n",
    "What is polymorphism? Different or related classes that use the same names for their functions.\n",
